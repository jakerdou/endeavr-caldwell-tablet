This program takes in block problem file and outputs to a file data about whether or not and how that block problem can be solved.

It takes 3 command line inputs:
input_filename - name of file to look for correctly formatted block problem
output_filename - name of file to output data to
You can include '-s' as the third command line argument to output data on the problem being solved to the console.

To run the 45 test problems I have created a shell script that will run the program for all of the problems and output the results to RESULTS.csv. You can use the command 'make run_tests' to run this shell script.
