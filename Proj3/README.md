This program takes in a filename to look for a knowledge base, and a filename to output the resulting knowledge base to.

It takes 2 command line inputs:
input_filename - name of file to look for knowledge base
output_filename - name of file to output data to

e.g. ./sammys sammys.kb sammys.txt

The tests for ROI that were not implemented in the final solution are included in sammys.cpp and output to the terminal.
